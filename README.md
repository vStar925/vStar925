# Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I showcase the variety of different projects and games I've created content and mods for.

##  Mortal Kombat Deception Remastered

A WIP texture pack for PCSX2 and Dolphin that aims to upscale/redraw every texture asset in the game.

## Red Dead Redemption 2

The first game I learned to mod in any serious capacity. This is definetly the game I've made the most content for (in terms of individual mods) but also believe I've reached my limit of ability and interest in so I don't mod this game anymore. Maybe I will one day, but I am currently retired from RDR2.

## Mods for Other Games

I've also dabbled in modding a few games, usually as a one-off thing as I was playing them. They don't really need their own section because of that so I am lumping them all together here.

### Fallout 4
---

[![F4.jpg](https://github.com/vStar925/vStar925/blob/main/F4.jpeg?raw=true)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53016?tab=description) 
Overhauls the quest log in your Pip-Boy to be more verbose (similar to Morrowind), and reduce the need to follow a floating marker everywhere.

---
### Manhunt
---
*[James Earl Cash Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/manhunt/mods/8)*

- Upscales Jame's head and body texture from 256x256 to 512x512 using AI upscale, photo-scanned buttons for his shirt, a more defined shoe print, more defined wrinkles, darker pupils, rougher eyebrows, a clearer font on the back of his shirt that reads COUNTY JAIL, and finally, adds a CASH inscription on the above his shirt pocket.
